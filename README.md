# Recommender-System

## Summary
- Understand content-based filtering, user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to recommend items to users.
- Apply a variety of algorithms: KNN, Matrix Factorization, RBMs, GRU4Rec.
- Combination of algorithms in ensemble approachs.
- Measurement of recommender system: hit rate, RMSE, MAE, Coverage, Diversity, Novelty, Churn, Responsive.
- 'Cold-start' problem: new user and item, stoplist, outliers, fraud of clickstream, international markets, temporal effect, value-aware recommendations.
- Use Spark for a large-scale system on a cluster.
